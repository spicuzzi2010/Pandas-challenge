# PyCiySchools Disctrict Analysis


The [PyCitySchools](./PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) contains analysis of the district-wide standardized test results and budget information. the [school and student csv's](./Resources) contain every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The notebook previously mentioned contains the aggregation of the data using python to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The report in the notebook will display the below  data
